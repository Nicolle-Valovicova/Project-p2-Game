Master of the Murder.

//? THE GOAL OF THE GAME 
When the raven falls, its treasure passes to the one who outmaneuvered the storm.
In this battlefield of birds, victory is not given it is claimed through cunning, courage, and calculated sacrifice.

//? MURDER’S GAMBIT LORE
Deep within Blackwing Vales, two ancient bird clans rule the forest canopy:
the Pale Murder of white crows and the Night Murder of black ravens.
For centuries, these flocks have fought for dominance, territory, and treasure.

Their battles follow an old ritual known as Murder’s Gambit 
a sacred war played on a moss-covered field of 64 tiles.
Every bird that falls releases golden spirit dust, the treasure of the forest.
Pawns drop a spark, powerful birds drop more, and a king’s fall ends the war instantly.

There are no ties, no truces, no mercy.
A flock that cannot move is considered defeated,
and the last Raven King standing claims all treasure spilled in battle.

Each piece in your murder ravens, rooks, magpies, crows, jays, and jackdaws 
is a living warrior obeying your command.
Every move is a strategy.
Every kill strengthens your hoard.
Every sacrifice shapes your fate.

In Murder’s Gambit, the clever, the bold, and the ruthless rise above the canopy.
Only one king will survive.
Only one murder will claim the forest.
